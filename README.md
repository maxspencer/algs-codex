Algorithms Code Examples

Just a collection of the datastructures and algorithms lectured in my second year Algorithms course, implemented in Python. I coded them up to help me understand, but the code is well commented and might be helpful to others trying to learn about the joys of:

* Fibonacci Heaps
* vEB Trees
* Disjoint Sets *
* Prim's and Kruskal's Algorithms *
* Dijkstra's Algorithm *

* - Yet to be committed..

Bugs
----

I think it's very likely that there are a lot of bugs. I haven't written any unit tests because the primary objective was to understand how the data structures work and not come up with proper usable implementations.

If you do find a bug, please enter it in the Issue tracker GitHub thing, or even better fix it!
